- Filename hashing
- Code splitting


- Use enty to manage client side state
- defer all other state to server side
- client selects server side state slices based on graphql queries (need a schema?).
- server dispatches 

or not?

- makes more sense to dispatch actions and have reducers create state sync between server & client
- just use bits of enty that are needed (schema, normalize and denormalize)
